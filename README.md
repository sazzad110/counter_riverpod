# counter_riverpod
This project is a simple counter app with a bottom navigation bar. Users can increment the counter by tapping on the screen, and there's an additional button to check if the current count is a prime number. Upon clicking the "Is prime?" button, users are directed to a new page where the app verifies if the current count is prime and prints the result accordingly. I've used Riverpod state management to handle this project.
